FIRST NAVIGATION

Brief
*this is the very first navigation at the top of the website.

Responsibilities
*It is the navigation that connects the user to quick locations on the website
*Locations like help, wish list, about the website, about the mobile app and a link to downloading the mobile app

*the responsive design makes it possible for the navigation to look presentable in the mobile version of the website
*in the mobile version the only thing missen is the link to the 'Buyer Protection' but it is added in the dropdown from the 'Help'
*the dropdown was implemented with jquery
